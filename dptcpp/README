This is an all-in-one C++ library serving simple solutions for simple yet common problems.

The library is for GNU/Linux.

Features include:
	- An exception-safe exception class capable of carrying a message and a position in code.
	  It is easy to inherit from this class and extend its capabilities.
	  
	- A group of simple debug macros either using domains that can be turned on or off
	  or simple macros that always write to the error stream. operator<< can be used
	  inside the macros to concatenate various informations of different types into one
	  message. Code position is also written to stderr. 
	  If the linked software is not compiled with -DDEBUG, the macros won't cause
	  any overhead: they simple disappear from the source.
	  
	- An interface for uniquely identifiable objects and a generic class for uniquely
	  identifiable types. (with which the template is instantiated)
